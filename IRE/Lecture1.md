### Minor Project details : 
  * Individual Project (4 Weeks)
  * Two deliverables
  * **Objective:** Design and develop a scalable and efficient search engine using the Wikipedia data. 
  * **Features:**
    * Dump of Wikipedia as document repository
    * Results obtained in less than a sec (even for long queries)
    * Supports field queries (ex: title)
    * Index size should be less than 1/4 of the data size.
    * You have to build your own indexing mechanism.
  * The evaluation will be done on **4 parameters** : 
    * Search time
    * Search efficiency
    * Indexing time
    * Index Size
  * You can use compression techniques
  * Explore several ranking functions (tf,tf-idf, normalized tf, normalized idf etc)
  * Create a secondary index if required.
  * **DEADLINES :**
    * First evaluation (29th August) :
      * Indexing time and Indexing efficiency will be evaluated.
      * Dummy queries will be provided before August 26th
    * Second (Final) evaluation (7th September) - All four parameters will be considered.

### Major Project
  * Group of 4 people (10 Weeks)
  * 5 touch points, 3 deliverables
  * report progress every 2 weeks.
  * Three deliverables :
    * Scope document by 26th September - Defining scope of what is to be worked on.
    * End-to-end system by 25th October – Most Viable Product deliverable 
    * Complete system by 14th November - Demo/presentation Video, Code, Report
